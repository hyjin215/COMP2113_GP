   - Encounter monsters and/or traps
   - Battle or shop interactions
   - Room cleared → Progress to next room
4. **Game End**: Victory (all rooms cleared) or Defeat (player HP = 0)

## Difficulty Scaling

| Difficulty | Total Rooms | Monster HP | Trap Damage | Shop Frequency  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Easy       | 10          | 0.8x       | Low         | Every 3-4 rooms |
| Normal     | 15          | 1.0x       | Medium      | Every 4-5 rooms |
| Hard       | 20          | 1.3x       | High        | Every 5-6 rooms |
